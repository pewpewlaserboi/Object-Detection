Zachary Labossiere Fire Extinguisher Object Detection Code

key**

"logs" contains the weights of the trained model with 40 epochs

"mrcnn" is the method of object detection using .json files that I created using 20 Images for training 
and 20 Images for verification

"output" is the result of the Fire_Ext_detection.ipynb

"train" contains all 20 images used for training and the .json file

"val" contains all 20 images used for verification and the .json file

"Fire_Ext_detection.ipynb" is the code to be used to identify fire extinguishers can quickly change the sample1.jpg to test
**make sure paths are correct**

"fire_ext_train.py" is the code used for training for object detection
